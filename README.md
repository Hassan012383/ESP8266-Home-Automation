# ESP8266-Home-Automation
A simple home automation project for our Electronic Devices and Circuits course. We used the ESP8266 micro-controller with the Blynk library.

The Objective of this project was to develop a device that our classmates would find useful and would be willing to buy for their personal use.
We went with the aim to create a low cost project (under Rs 5000 or 30$) as to make to accesible and cheap to manufacture.
We got an A for this course which was nice.

It also had a C02 level detector that if triggered to blink red LEDs and a buzzer would buzz. 
Further more it supported battery back up as well as an adapter for power.
